# IoT simulation for CRDT

This is a small IoT simulation. You can use the command line to make cars enter and exit a road so they could be charged a toll (much like the Ontario 407 highway).

This is simuilation is designed to work nicely with Redis Enterprise's implementation of CRDTs so multiple clusters can resolve conflicts automatically.
